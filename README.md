# WalkerRoad
A Client-Server Game Environment/Protocol For Verification And Validation.

Using the concept found in games, you try to frame the process of validation in a one server with multiple client architecture. Basically setting up a closed system where parameters can be set and the range of possible values are spread over many clients.

Running the Demo:

1) Build the two executables. walkerroad_c and walkerroad_d.

2) Run the server first. i.e. walkerroad_d.

3) Run the client(s) after that. i.e. walkerroad_c.


The two programs are set up to run in one machine. The client(s) will connect to the server right away and run ad infinitum.

The demo is just used for that, demonstrating the concept. You can add handlers to both the Server and Client piece to define your own simulation.
